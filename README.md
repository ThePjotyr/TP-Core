This Data Pack is a library for Data Packs made by me. Feel free to use it if you found something interesting. It mostly contains tags and predicates that I frequently use.

## Armor storage

With custom functions in namespace **tp_armor** you can indefinitely store players armor in custom storages. Thanks to this you can hide player armor for some time and then give it back to them. Use commands below to achieve what you want:

*Save player's armor into custom storage*
> /function tp_armor:save_armor

*Clear player's armor slots*
> /function tp_armor:clear_armor

*Give player's armor back into armor slots*
> /function tp_armor:give_armor
